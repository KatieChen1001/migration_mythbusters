      As you've explored our project, we hope you've gained a more nuanced
      understanding of the challenges faced by migrants from Central America.
      So, what's next? Well, we encourage you to be a migration mythbuster and
      critically evaluate media coverage that perpetuates negative stereotypes.
      Consider taking action by volunteering, supporting organizations that work
      with migrants, or engaging in dialogue with friends and family. Together,
      we can build a more compassionate and informed society - and have some fun
      busting myths along the way.
