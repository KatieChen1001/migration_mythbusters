    In the realm of migration, misconceptions often tip the scales, leading to
    underestimations and overestimations of the challenges that migrant workers
    face. It's time to strike a balance by busting these myths and uncovering
    the true intricacies of migrant experiences. The perception of how easy or
    difficult it is to migrate to the United States varies among Americans and
    is influenced by personal experience, political affiliation, and geographic
    location. According to the Cato Institute 2021 Immigration and Identity
    National Survey of 2,600 U.S. adults, more than two‐​thirds (67%) of
    Americans believe legally immigrating to the United States is “fairly
    difficult” while a third (33%) think it’s fairly easy. By recalibrating our
    understanding, we can foster well-informed policies and garner public
    support that addresses the diverse needs of migrant workers, ultimately
    promoting their successful integration and restoring equilibrium in host
    societies. Just like Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman, we use hard facts,
    statistics, and evidence to reveal the truth beneath the rhetoric. So,
    buckle up and prepare to have your assumptions challenged as we dismantle
    misconceptions and uncover the genuine impact of migration on our world. We
    encourage you to engage with our visualizations, read the <span
      class="bolded">additional insights shared in our tooltips</span
    > and interact with our questionnaires to see how
    your current image of the phenomenon compares with the facts suggested by the
    data.

    Hopefully, at the end of it all, we'll prove to you that, when it comes to
    migration, the facts are often far more enlightening than fiction.
