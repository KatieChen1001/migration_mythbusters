# Interactive Data Visualization Story: Debunking Central American Migration Myths

## Overview

This project aims to debunk common myths and misconceptions surrounding Central American migration through an interactive data visualization story. By combining data-driven visualizations with informative narratives, we hope to shed light on the realities of migration from Central America. 

We believe in making this project engaging and educational for users. As part of the interactive experience, we encourage users to actively participate by estimating answers to questions related to Central American migration before revealing the actual data. This feature helps challenge preconceived notions and fosters a deeper understanding of the topic.
